			In lab coat white, with knowledge bright, a student pharmacist takes flight, in pharmacies,
			they learn the art, to heal and soothe, to play their part.
		</p>
		<p>
			With mortar and pestle, they blend and mix, compounding potions, fixing the fix, calculating
			doses with meticulous care, to ease the burdens that patients bear.
		</p>
		<p>
			They study drugs, their powers vast, from humble aspirin to drugs so fast, to mend the body,
			to ease the pain, in pursuit of health, they strive again.
		</p>
		<p>
			With empathy and skill, they walk the aisle, guiding patients with a knowing smile, a student
			pharmacist, with heart sincere, in their hands, hope and healing appear.
